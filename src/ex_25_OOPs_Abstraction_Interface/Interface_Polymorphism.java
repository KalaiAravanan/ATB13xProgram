        /*Objective:
        Learn how interfaces support polymorphism â€“ calling the same method on different implementations.
        ðŸ”¶ Steps:
            1.	Create an interface Playable with method play().
            2.	Create two classes: Guitar and Piano, both implement Playable.
            3.	Implement the play() method in both classes with different messages.
            4.	In main(), declare a reference of type Playable and assign it objects of Guitar and Piano one by one.
            5.	Call play() on each.
        ðŸ”¶ Expected Output:
        Playing Guitar
        Playing Piano */
